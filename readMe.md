### Notes

Created as part of <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails'>The Odin Project CS course.</a>

A friend of mine once challenged me to find the solution of a knight travailing the chess board, passing each square only once, i have never figured it out, perhaps i should return to the old problem sometime soon and provide a full solution.
